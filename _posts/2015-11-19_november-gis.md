A time in November to meet again informally and talk about maps. If you book a "ticket" on eventbrite, it really helps encourage others to turn up and you can be e-mailed when future dates are announced.

* Date: Thursday 19th Novmeber 2015
* Time: 6pm to 7:30pm, or as late as the conversation goes
* Location: The Library (also known as Varsity), Saddler Street, Durham.
* Co-ordinates: 54.7756, -1.5745.
* How to find us: Table 2 at the front, maps on the table!

This month we're following [GIS day](http://www.gisday.com/). So let's make that our theme. To get the conversation, what geospatial data manipulation or analyzing do you like to do? Do you want to show us what software you use, or a great function in it? Or just come and listen and learn.

The Library is a good place to get a beer, cider, tea, coffee, or even a smoothie, and there's free wifi.
