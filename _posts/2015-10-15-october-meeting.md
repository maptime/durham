A time in October to meet again informally and talk about maps. Maps we like to create, maps we like to look at, maps we want to know more about, and even tools used to make maps. Everyone welcome. 

* Date: Thursday 15th October 2015
* Time: 6pm to 7:30pm, or as late as the conversation goes
* Location: The Library (also known as Varsity), Saddler Street, Durham.
* Co-ordinates: 54.7756, -1.5745.
* How to find us: Table 2 at the front, maps on the table!

The Library is a good place to get a beer, cider, tea, coffee, or even a smoothie, and there's free wifi.

You could bring a map to get the conversation going. Real or fictional, doodle or professional product. Or in the spirit of Maptime, we might start drawing some maps during the meeting.
