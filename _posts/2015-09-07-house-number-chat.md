Last Wednesday the first Durham meeting of Maptime took place ath The Library on Saddler Street. With the academic term not yet underway, Durham was almost a ghost town and so it was expected this gathering might be on the small side. It made the pub nice and quiet and three of us sat down to some drinks.

Dicussion got on to house numbering and address data, which company/organisation has the best data. It's certainly something that would be valuable and [Royal Mail tried collecting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18883772) precise "delivery point" locations until the unions objected to extra work. Many OpenStreetMap volunteers, myself included, are starting to [add house numbers](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr) but it's detailed and extensive work hence the business value. We also talked about Google Maps briefly, but what map lovers ever talk about Google more than briefly?

Am I right that there is more interest with this group? Let's try [later in the month](http://maptime.io/durham/2015/10/15/october-meeting/) to avoid the busy time of Freshers' Week...
