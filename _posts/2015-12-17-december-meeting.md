A time in December to meet again informally and talk about maps. If you book a "ticket" on eventbrite, it really helps encourage others to turn up and you can be e-mailed when future dates are announced.

* Date: Thursday 17th December 2015
* Time: 6pm to 7:30pm, or as late as the conversation goes
* Location: The Library (also known as Varsity), Saddler Street, Durham.
* Co-ordinates: 54.7756, -1.5745.
* How to find us: Table 2 at the front, maps on the table!

For our December meetup we will discuss "Jerry Mapping", and then do some! To create a map of an imaginary place, [Jerry Gretzinger](http://www.jerrysmap.com/) illustrates a single square of the map. Picking from a shuffled deck of cards decides in which direction he will add a new square and what it will contain (a village, mountains, a city...). You don't need artistic skills or mapping knowledge, you can just come along to listen and chat about what Jerry Mapping and encourage each other. Gregory will bring some pencils and paper to share, bring your own materials if you wish.

Purchases not required in our group but The Library is a good place to get a beer, cider, tea, coffee, or even a smoothie, and there's free wifi. Food is also available.

After December, we're considering switching the group to meeting every 2 months, a date in Feburary is yet to be decided.
