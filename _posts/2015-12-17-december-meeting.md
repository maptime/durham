A time in December to meet again informally and talk about maps. If you book a "ticket" on eventbrite, it really helps encourage others to turn up and you can be e-mailed when future dates are announced.

* Date: Thursday 17th December 2015
* Time: 6pm to 7:30pm, or as late as the conversation goes
* Location: The Library (also known as Varsity), Saddler Street, Durham.
* Co-ordinates: 54.7756, -1.5745.
* How to find us: Table 2 at the front, maps on the table!

The theme for December is still to be decided (if we continue doing themes). Possible options are: Mapping in humanitarian situations; Maps and art. Come along in November to discuss which we do, or suggest other themes.

The Library is a good place to get a beer, cider, tea, coffee, or even a smoothie, and there's free wifi.
