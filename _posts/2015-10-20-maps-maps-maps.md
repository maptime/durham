For our second meeting, five of us gathered round a table to talk maps - almost double last week!

The conversation started with 3D mapping of buildings, so we opened [F4 Map in Durham](http://demo.f4map.com/#lat=54.7709423&lon=-1.5720877&zoom=20&camera.theta=63.564) to see the little trial of roof tagging I did a while back - it's complicated and will be time consuming so might take a while. I think we discussed that the Environment Agency's recent lidar release would help with that. Myself and Steven have had a brief look at the data. From 3D mapping we once again moved onto house numbering, I'm not the only one to have done that in Durham - thanks Greta. Roger has spent a lot of time with house number data from the council, and methods to estimate whether a property is a student let or not. That took us on a brief but happy tangent away from maps and geospatil to the workings of Durham Student Union.

We explored OpenStreetMap data in various places around the city, all our favourite places and interesting stories where we've seen things change. Including cycle racks, then Martin told us the council are wanting to survey all cycle racks and conducting a pilot in Chester-Le-Street. This immeditely reminds me of the DfT's "[England Cycle Data](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/England_Cycling_Data_project#Background)" project that got halted because it was a better tactic to improve OpenStreetMap data with widths and surface quality of paths. We're going to see if we can inform the council about that so funding is put to the most effective use and work only done from scratch if appropriate.

We did some live mapping during the meeting, of a [sculpture of a map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3787925251#map=18/54.76855/-1.57386) on the university Science Site. It's a map inside a map! Oh, that also led us to point out the examples of the [Great Polish Map of Scotland](http://www.livingwithdragons.com/2013/01/a-geographic-information-systemgis-without-electricity) and [The World in Dubai](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/25.2237/55.1617).

It was a great meetup and brilliant to meet you all. I didn't get on to discussing our Maptime generally, but we could do that over social media or a meetup in a months time. Is the location and evening a good time for people? Should we be more organised with a subject for each meetup or are we happy for now? It took me a few days to compile this write-up, if anyone else wanted to do it after a meeting then we can sort out the easiest ability to do that. I also think Eventbrite will become more useful as I can send an e-mail out to past attendees of when the next date will be.
