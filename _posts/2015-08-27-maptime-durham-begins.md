Considering Durham has lots of people that enjoy and create maps as their work, academia, or hobby, I've created a Maptime chapter so we can come together and learn from each other.

Maptime is welcoming to all, and crosses different technologies and map times, the mission...
> Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested, regardless of background, by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies, primarily the open source ones. 

> This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.

I'm not sure where to take this group, I'd love some help and support. I understand the first few events might not be best suited locations, times, or content to a lot of people. Get in touch [mailto:maptime@nomoregrapes.com](with me) with suggestions on alternatives that would work for you or people you know. This group should belong to all the people that want to attend...
