To start off Maptime in Durham, let's have the first informal gathering to see who is interested. We can talk about maps we like to create or look at.

* Date: Wednesday 2nd September 2015
* Time: 6pm to 7:45pm, or as late as the conversation goes
* Location: The Library Durham (also known as Varsity), Saddler Street.
* Co-ordinates: 54.7756, -1.5745.
* How to find us: Table 2 at the front, maps on the table!

You could bring a map to get the conversation going. Real or fictional, doodle or professional product. Or in the spirit of Maptime, we might start drawing some maps during the meeting.
